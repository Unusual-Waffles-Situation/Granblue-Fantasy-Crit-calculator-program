Program to calculate the crit porcentage from your grid. OUTDATED SINCE LAST GAME UPDATE.

## OUTDATED SINCE LAST GAME UPDATE, AS THE NEW BUFF TO MAGNA SUMMONS CHANGES THE FORMULA I

## EXPLAIN:
Because of how obtuse the game can be sometimes, this program is to help in calculating the crit porcentage of your grid with just a couple of clicks.

## HOW TO USE:

This is the main view of the program. First, you have to select the summon option:
* Single summon: If you are using any of the Magna/Primal summons with any support summon or viceversa.
* Double summon: If you are using the same summon for main and support (eg. Double Tiamat, Double Varuna, etc).
* Another summon: This is for OTK purpose.

After selecting the summon, the program will show you your selected option; as seen below:

To add a weapon, you can click the "Add weapon" button, it will show the following:

After selecting the weapon, click the "Choose weapon options" to select how many weapons you want to add, as well as the skill level of the weapon:

Afterward, press the "Next" button to continue. If you want to check your selected weapons, you can click the "Show selected weapons" button:

If you want to delete the last added weapon, you can click the "Delete weapon" button.

When you added all the desired weapons, click the "Calculate crit value":

With the result, we can have 3 weapons and have more than 100% crit porcentage.

Knowing this, we can add other weapons to the grid, instead of using another copy of the same weapon and have wasted crit porcentage.
